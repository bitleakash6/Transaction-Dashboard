## Objective

This project is a MERN stack application designed to manage and query product transactions fetched from a third-party API. The backend initializes the database with data from the API and provides endpoints for querying and statistics. The frontend displays this data in a table and charts, with functionalities for search, pagination, and filtering by month.
